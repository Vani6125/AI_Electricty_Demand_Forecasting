# âš¡ Electricity Demand Forecasting

A Machine Learning project that forecasts electricity demand using historical time series data. This project utilizes the ARIMA model for accurate forecasting and is presented with a user-friendly web interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Electricity demand forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management, minimizing generation costs, and maintaining grid stability. In this project, we used ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for short-term load prediction based on historical electricity demand data.
