        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is electricity demand and peak load forecasting?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Electricity demand forecasting is the process of predicting future energy consumption over a specific period, such as monthly or yearly. This helps utilities plan energy generation and distribution efficiently.<br><br>Peak load forecasting focuses on identifying times when electricity demand will be at its highest. This is crucial for grid operators to manage supply effectively, avoid overloading, and ensure grid reliability during peak demand periods.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How accurate are the forecasts?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The accuracy of forecasts depends on the quality and quantity of data used and the sophistication of the forecasting models. AI-based systems typically achieve high accuracy, as they use advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and trends. These systems continually improve their predictions by learning from new data. In real-world scenarios, accuracy rates of 85-95% are common, with short-term forecasts (e.g., hourly or daily) being more precise than long-term forecasts.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What data is used for forecasting?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The forecasting system uses a variety of data sources, including:<br><br>
                1. Historical Electricity Consumption Data: Past usage patterns for specific period (ex: years).<br>
                2. Weather Data: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, which significantly impact electricity demand.<br>
                3. Economic Indicators: GDP, industrial activity, and population growth, which influence long-term demand trends.<br>
                4. Event Data: Holidays, festivals, and weekends that may impact energy consumption.<br>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How does this system help in reducing costs?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">An AI-based forecasting system helps reduce costs in several ways:<br><br>
                1. Optimized Energy Generation: By accurately predicting demand, utilities can generate the right amount of electricity, avoiding overproduction (which leads to waste) or underproduction (which can cause outages).<br>
                2. Efficient Resource Allocation: The system helps balance the use of renewable and non-renewable energy sources, reducing reliance on expensive backup power plants during peak periods.<br>
                3. Reduced Penalties: By complying with regulatory standards and ensuring stable grid operations, utilities avoid penalties associated with non-compliance or grid failures.<br>
                4. Minimized Operational Costs: Accurate forecasts reduce the need for emergency measures like buying energy from external sources at premium prices during peak demand.<br>
                5. Enhanced Grid Stability: By preventing outages and overloading, the system reduces maintenance costs and extends the lifespan of grid infrastructure.</div>
